# HANDOFF — for the next session

Read `BUILD-ORDER.md` first: it says which step we are on and what "done" means. Then `STATE.md` for what
is verified. This file only says where the last session stopped.

## 2026-09-22 — where this session stopped

**Step 7 is live** (PR #11 merged, `10e51cc`). **Step 8 is built on branch `step-8`**: 8a–8d (ADR 0023, 0030 — a
question's skills read from the question, a wrong answer charged to the skill whose step broke, evidence per
skill) and, widened the same day to the team's *Addition & Subtraction Assessment Skill Taxonomy*, 8e–8i (ADR
0031 — 269 cases as rows, levels that hold named cases, 8 new kinds of question, 4 new skills, the bank refilled).
Rehearsed end to end on a fresh copy of live: `engine bank taxonomy` "269 cases · 269 covered · 0 missing · 0
thin", `engine library check` "0 problems", a second refill and a second build change nothing (STATE, 8i).

**Live since 13:56 IST** (PRs #13 and #14; numbers in STATE, 8i). The engine was down 13:16–13:56 after #13 — the
story templates were outside the image; fixed in #14. `go-live.sh` could not upload from this Mac (its network
corrupted every transfer above 16 KB); the server fetched the commit from GitHub and was proved identical to it.
Rerun `deploy/go-live.sh` once the network is sound, so the server again comes from the script. **Not yet proved:
a signed-in click-through on the live link.**

**Done since:** Nimish approved step 8's skills (live `engine audit` 0), merged #12 and ran its data job (queue 190 →
454). **Next:** Nimish checks child by child — PR #16 makes a child's papers links with previous/next paper.
**Owed:** `deploy/go-live.sh` from `origin/main`, so the server carries #12's code (the permission check refused a
production deploy from this session; this Mac's network was corrupting uploads 13:40–14:20).

**Open from before, unchanged:** validation (step 6 closes when nothing waits and `engine gold check` has every
finding in the graph); the reader and the teacher's red pen (ADR 0020, no answer yet); PR #12 (`reader-trust`,
ADR 0029) open in the worktree `assessment-engine-reader`.

## Queued reader fixes — found on crops, held while coverage is held

- `G4-SEPW1` q7: two labelled answer boxes wider than `ocr.box_max_width` are thrown away as working area.
- `G3-SEPW1-A` q5: nine answers in nine small printed boxes, one found.
- `G4-SEPW1` q3: the child's digits sit inside the printed line ("4[6] + [5]4 = 100"), so the slot is `not_found`.
- `G2-CAM-C` q1b: "98" at 74.8% where the child probably wrote 48.
- **Do not retry without the silent-error count beside it:** 200 dpi (84.2% exact, 5 silently wrong), the scan's
  own dpi (76.8%), white margins (80.5%, 2 silently wrong), CLAHE/deskew — ADR 0020.

## Carried over — Nimish's calls, not blockers

- **Grade 1**: some levels hold every question there is, below a class need of 216 — `ADD.1D.WITHIN10` Easy 20,
  Hard 24; `ADD.1D.BRIDGE10` Hard 45; `SUB.1D.WITHIN20` Hard 44 (all floors: STATE, 8h).
- **W2's live n8n run**: n8n Cloud cannot reach the engine on a laptop — a hosting decision.
- **Four pedagogy questions** for Neha, Achal and Aseem: format mixing on `SUB.2D.EXCH` Hard; the provisional gold
  set's revise-or-reject case; the G1 floors; which rung place value, comparison and rounding belong on.
- Standing: Achal's and Neha's emails for `app.staff`; rotate the database password; `AUTH_SECRET` on Vercel if
  unset; the n8n owner account and its two credentials (`n8n/README.md`); GitHub branch protection (Team plan).

## Traps — do not repeat

- **Building out of order**, or **pivoting from chat**: restate, get a yes, write it into `BUILD-ORDER.md`, build.
- **Answering "is X built?" with a mechanism instead of a number.**
- **Measuring on synthetic images.** Every W3 number comes from the real pages.
- **A `blank` is a claim, not a flag**: it lands in the graph as "did not attempt".
- **Inventing a code verifier where none exists** (R7, R11, R13, X1, X2): route through a person.
- **Names stay out of the repository**: the ingest map and `gold_findings.json` live beside the papers.
- **A migration the website reads goes to live before the merge** (PR #10 merged first; rescued in minutes).
- **`legacy.remark` before 2026-09-21** would have undone people's corrections — fixed; re-marking now skips any
  answer a person settled.
- **A file the engine reads while it runs, outside `engine/`**: the server's image holds `engine/` alone. Step 8's
  story templates under `supabase/seed/` kept the live engine restarting after PR #13 (2026-09-22);
  `tests/test_image.py` now starts the engine from that folder alone.
- **Editing this file by slicing it**: a 2026-09-21 edit dropped everything after its own section; rebuilt from
  git (`970e605`).
- Still true, technical: `engine/assess/mark.py` 0% covered, imported by nothing; `legacy.PAPERS` unused;
  `apps/web/lib/queries.ts` one `regexp_replace(c.roll_no, '\D', …)` whose backslash the template literal eats;
  five `react-hooks/static-components` errors in `apps/web/app/(app)/library/page.tsx`; `legacy.py` (820+ lines),
  `cli.py` and `assess/misconceptions.py` over the 400-line ceiling.
