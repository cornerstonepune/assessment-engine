# STATE — what is verified true

Each line: a claim, the command that proves it, its last output. No claim without a check.

## Design

- Spec approved in shape by Nimish (approach A); written as `SPEC.md`; awaiting his read-through.
- ADRs 0001–0003 record the stack, the skill model, and the n8n boundary.

## Inputs verified

- Registry: `window.CSMAP` from the Skill Map Review artifact — 244 skills, 849 milestones,
  14 domains, NUM = 37 skills. All seven skill ids the ladder maps to exist
  (`NUM.OPS.01/.02/.05`, `NUM.PRB.02/.03`, `NUM.PV.03`, `NUM.MEAS.04`).
  Check: `python3 -c` parse of `data.js` → counts above.
- Prototype: `~/Downloads/assessment-engine-prototype/assess/` — 8 modules; synthetic roundtrip
  report: cell geometry agreement 1.0 on 4/4 sheets, QR decoded 12/12 pages; status agreement
  0.40–0.70 with the Tesseract stub (not for handwriting, by its own docstring).
- Existing scans: 13 `ACE Scanner_20260916(N).pdf` — none carry fiducials or a QR, none have a
  text layer. Check: prototype `find_fiducials` + `cv2.QRCodeDetector` on page 1 of each → 0/13.
  Therefore every existing assessment goes through legacy import. Real Phase 1 input is
  whatever Nimish uploads to `~/cornerstone/assessments/` (layout in its README); the Downloads
  scans were evidence only.
- Team documents incorporated: `Addition_Subtraction_Assessment_Skill_Taxonomy.pdf` (13 pp;
  §12 tag matrix, §13 progression) and `Adaptive_Subtraction_Learning_Engine_…Spec.docx`
  (M001–M010 conceptual misconceptions).

## Handwriting reading — first real measurement (2026-09-17)

One real Grade 3 paper (`ACE Scanner_20260916(2).pdf` p1, Sep Week 1), name band masked before
sending, `legacy_extract` prompt v1, `gemini-3.5-flash`, 1,237 in / 695 out tokens.

Read correctly, checked against the page: Q1 a=53 b=612 c=1250 d=36 (all four arithmetically
consistent); Q2 balance = 600; Q3 blank and circled, correctly reported as not attempted;
Q4 number line landing 78, answer 83; Q6 column 675+589 = 1264. It also caught the teacher's
circles on Q1 b/d, and on Q5 read the child's partition of 638 as 600+19+19 — a wrong method
reaching a right answer (1113), which is exactly the diagnostic signal the product exists to find.

**Status: promising signal, not a measurement.** One page, one child. The real figure comes from
the Phase 1 `gold` set against Aseem's own marking.

Three things this spike changed:
1. `legacy_extract` needs a `part` field — Q1's four lettered sub-answers arrived crammed into one
   string. Marking needs one row per response.
2. Teacher annotations are legible to the model. Useful for Channel B; Channel A must be told not
   to read a teacher's circle as the child's answer.
3. Free tier returns 503 and intermittent 404 under load. The adapter needs retry with backoff
   and an ordered model fallback list, not a single pinned id.

Model availability (checked live, `models.list`): flash line runs to `gemini-3.8-flash`;
`gemini-3.8-flash` was overloaded, `gemini-3.5-flash` served. `gemini-2.5-flash` — the brain's
2026-09-08 choice — is now three generations back. Never use the `gemini-flash-latest` alias:
a silent model change would invalidate every accuracy measurement taken against it.

## Code

- None yet. Phase 0 starts after the spec review.
- macOS python.org build has no CA bundle; the engine venv must include `certifi`.

## Environment

- Docker, Supabase CLI, psql, Node, Python 3.14 present; n8n not installed (Docker);
  `gh` authenticated as nimishshah1989, admin of org `cornerstonepune`.
